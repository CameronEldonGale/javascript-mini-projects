//Create a car object. There should be a speed property with a numerical value and an increaseSpeed method. 
//The increaseSpeed method will increase the speed by 5. 


//Invoke the method to increase the speed of the car.



//Write a function that will increase the speed by any amount on any object.



//Add that function as a method on the car object. Then invoke it with any number as the argument.




//Uncomment the console.log below to make sure your speed was increased.
//console.log(car.speed)




//Create 10 cars, where each car has a color and number. The cars should be numbered in order from 0 to 9. The cars from 0 to 4 should be colored "green" and 
//the cars from 5 to 9 should be colored "blue". Place the cars in order in an array called carGarage.
//HINT: Use a constructor function and the keyword this. Don't just write out 10 car objects!
